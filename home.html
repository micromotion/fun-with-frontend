	<h1>What's the point?</h1>
	<p>
		Quizinator is fast pace, fun, and you'll learn quite a bit while playing. It's perfect when you're bored, got nothing else to do, or while you're waiting on the bus.

		Please note that none of your personal information is stored by us. All information needed for keeping records of your highscore is handled by your web browser. This means that if you're for example using Chrome when answering the quiz, your score will only be remembered by that browser and not by any other browser you may have installed. Do not clear your web storage on your browser if you don't want to loose your highscore. You'll need to enable javascript to answer the quiz and your browser need to support web storage if you want to keep track of your highscore. Last but not least. Have fun!
